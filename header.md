title: Go By Assertion
author: Ernesto Garbarino
date: 2019-11-07
abstract: This is a "Go by Example" reference except that it relies on Unit Testing Assertions as opposed to print statements. 
---

For convenience, the assertions are stylised as follows:

* `assert.Equal(t, a, b)` is shown as `a ⇔ b`
* `assert.NotEqual(t, a, b)` is shown as `a ⇎ b`
